				<h1>About Me</h1>
			
			<p id="myText">My name is Victor Romero, I am Mexican now a nationalized U.S. citizen, and I am at an early point in what I know will be a long journey in software development.  I graduated from High School in 2010 and attended the California State Polytechnic University Pomona from 2010-2015, where I earned my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science.  During my freshmen year in college I was interested in Chemical Engineering.  However, I later found my true passion in computer programming. I was accepted in the Computer Science department in my second year.  At Cal Poly Pomona I learned programming concepts such as algorithms, analysis of algorithms, concepts of programming languages as well as other fundamentals which will allow me to excel in industry.  While at Cal Poly I was also given the opportunity to gain hands on experience.  The professors always encouraged us to work on our own ideas and they always informed us of the best internships.  It is because of this that I have several projects of my own and two internships at the highly prestigious Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. I feel that I am at a point where I am ready to begin my career.  I am ready to take on new challenges, which I feel fully prepared for given all my preparation up until this point and I am very excited to find out where my next adventure will take me!</p>
